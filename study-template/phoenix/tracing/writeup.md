Observing Applications Using Traces for LLM Systems
Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into complex applications, interacting with retrieval engines, external APIs, and orchestration agents. Understanding the behavior of such systems requires visibility into their internal operations without direct inspection of every component. LLM Traces and Observability provide a solution: they allow developers to ask questions like “Why is this happening?” or “What sequence of operations led here?” by collecting telemetry data from execution steps.

Purpose of LLM Traces

LLM Traces are a category of telemetry data designed to capture the execution of LLMs and the surrounding application context. They serve several purposes:

Troubleshooting: Quickly diagnose and resolve unexpected issues, including “unknown unknowns.”

Understanding: Reveal the inner workings of how requests are processed step by step.

Performance Monitoring: Provide visibility into system-level performance and efficiency.

Context Awareness: Track dependencies such as retrieval from vector stores or API calls.

Traces are composed of spans, where each span represents a single unit of work (e.g., a request to an API, a call to an LLM, or a document re-ranking step). Collectively, spans create a timeline of operations, painting a complete picture of application behavior.

Structure of Traces

A span corresponds to a specific operation during the lifecycle of a request. Spans are sequentially linked to form a trace, making it possible to:

Follow the execution flow of a request.

Track dependencies between components.

Measure the duration and performance of each step.

By analyzing traces, developers can identify where delays, failures, or inefficiencies occur.

Span Kinds Supported in LLM Tracing

LLM tracing systems typically support several specialized span kinds tailored for AI workflows:

LLM – Captures calls to a language model (completion or chat).

Chain – Represents links between different application steps, showing orchestration logic.

Tool – Logs API or function invocations made on behalf of an LLM.

Agent – Denotes the root of a set of LLM and tool invocations, representing orchestration entities.

Embedding – Records encoding of unstructured data into vector representations.

Retriever – Tracks queries for contextual information from a datastore.

Reranker – Captures the relevance-based reordering of retrieved documents.

Benefits of Observability with LLM Traces

Debugging: Identify failing tools, bottlenecks in retrieval, or LLM misbehavior.

Optimization: Improve system design by measuring execution times of each step.

Explainability: Provide end-to-end transparency of how a final response was generated.

Resilience: Quickly adapt to novel issues through visibility into system dependencies.

Conclusion

LLM Traces and Observability transform opaque AI-driven systems into transparent, diagnosable workflows. By capturing spans across LLM calls, retrievals, embeddings, and orchestration logic, they enable both operational excellence and developer productivity. As applications built with LLMs grow in complexity, tracing will become indispensable for ensuring reliability, accountability, and trust.
