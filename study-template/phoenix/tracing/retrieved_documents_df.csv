9c76d06b3c10a73b24c25bd2911b0185,How do I configure a threshold if my data has seasonality trends?,"
Automatic thresholds set a dynamic threshold value for each data point. Arize generates an auto threshold when there are at least 14 days of production data to determine a trend. You can edit your auto threshold sensitivity by changing the standard deviation number in the 'Monitor Settings' card.&#x20;

Learn more here about how an auto threshold value is calculated.&#x20;

Auto Threshold

"
9c76d06b3c10a73b24c25bd2911b0185,How do I configure a threshold if my data has seasonality trends?,"
Autothresholds are calculated based on a statistical analysis of data over 14 days. Each day, a data point is collected, and after 14 days, the average (mean) and standard deviation of these data points are computed. The thresholds is then set by adding or subtracting the standard deviation from the average.

"
9c76d06b3c10a73b24c25bd2911b0185,How do I configure a threshold if my data has seasonality trends?,"
Your baseline can help indicate why your model has drifted. &#x20;

To detect drift over time, set your baseline using **training data** to identify how your model changes between your features, predictions, and actuals. To detect short-term drift, set your baseline using **historical production data** (i.e. 2 weeks).

"

"
964eb99631cbb5cd07d4b13d4a623f19,How are clusters in the UMAP calculated? When are the clusters refreshed?,"
The UMAP visualization requires each datapoint's prediction ID to be unique. If there are are multiple predictions sent with the same prediction ID, the UMAP visualization cannot fetch all of the columns (features, tags, etc) of that datapoint. Since certain fields of this datapoint cannot be fetched, some color by options will be restricted.&#x20;

Embedding Projectors are a great tool in visualizing and interpreting embeddings. In order to do so, we have to apply an algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings to 2D/3D. UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique that belongs to the neighbor graph category. Arize uses it to create a lower dimensional representation (2D or 3D) of your dataset, represented by embedding vectors.&#x20;

"
ebed602390983649ac848f0f23a0d220,How does Arize calculate AUC?,"
Arize drift detection can show the % of values outside of the baseline range. Arize uses the quantiles of the data to calculate the bins of the distribution. If the baseline range has a larger range than the production/serving environment, the user can see the % of volume where the baseline distribution was outside of the production/serving distribution. If the production/serving distribution was outside the range of the baseline distribution, similarly Arize surfaces the % of volume for values outside the baseline range.

"
ebed602390983649ac848f0f23a0d220,How does Arize calculate AUC?,"
Arize calculates the bins within the drift tab using quantiles and fixed bins from the baseline distribution.

The range between two quantile values in the baseline distribution are utilized to calculate a fixed width for binning. That fixed width value will be used to calculate a finite set of bins (currently 8) of a fixed width from the Median value, in both directions (4 in each direction). Lastly, it adds bins to the ""bookends"", one from min value to lowest bin's edge and another from largest bin's edge to maximum value amongst both distributions.

This strategy optimizes for reasonable sized bins by calculating a fixed width based on quantile values.

"
bc0860b299fc7871332fb7c75fdfee52,How do I send embeddings to Arize?,"
Generating embeddings is likely another problem to solve, on top of ensuring your model is performing properly. With our Python SDK, you can offload that task to Arize and we will generate the embeddings for you. We use large, pre-trained models that will capture information from your inputs and encode it into embedding vectors.&#x20;

We extract the embeddings in the appropriate way depending on your use case, and we return it to you to include in your pandas DataFrame, which you then send to Arize.

Auto-Embeddings works end-to-end, you don't have to worry about formatting your inputs for the correct model. By simply passing your input, an embedding will come out as a result. We take care of everything in between.

Arize drift detection can show the % of values outside of the baseline range. Arize uses the quantiles of the data to calculate the bins of the distribution. If the baseline range has a larger range than the production/serving environment, the user can see the % of volume where the baseline distribution was outside of the production/serving distribution. If the production/serving distribution was outside the range of the baseline distribution, similarly Arize surfaces the % of volume for values outside the baseline range.

Arize calculates the bins within the drift tab using quantiles and fixed bins from the baseline distribution.

The range between two quantile values in the baseline distribution are utilized to calculate a fixed width for binning. That fixed width value will be used to calculate a finite set of bins (currently 8) of a fixed width from the Median value, in both directions (4 in each direction). Lastly, it adds bins to the ""bookends"", one from min value to lowest bin's edge and another from largest bin's edge to maximum value amongst both distributions.

This strategy optimizes for reasonable sized bins by calculating a fixed width based on quantile values.

There are many ways to extract embeddings depending on your use-case and your model. You can either generate your own embeddings or let Arize generate them for you.&#x20;

Generating embeddings is likely another problem to solve, on top of ensuring your model is performing properly. With our Python SDK, you can offload that task to Arize and we will generate the embeddings for you. We use large, pre-trained models that will capture information from your inputs and encode it into embedding vectors.&#x20;

We extract the embeddings in the appropriate way depending on your use case, and we return it to you to include in your pandas DataFrame, which you then send to Arize.

Auto-Embeddings works end-to-end, you don't have to worry about formatting your inputs for the correct model. By simply passing your input, an embedding will come out as a result. We take care of everything in between.
