Ranking models are used by search engines to display query results ranked in the order of the highest relevance. These predictions seek to maximize user actions that are then used to evaluate model performance.&#x20;

The complexity within a ranking model makes failures challenging to pinpoint as a model’s dimensions expand per recommendation. Notable challenges within ranking models include upstream data quality issues, poor-performing segments, the cold start problem, and more. &#x20;






If you upload multiple of the same ranks for the same prediction group id, you may run into problems visualizing your data within the platform. Revise your data to represent unique ranks for a given prediction group and re-upload your data. &#x20;

What drift metrics are supported in Arize?,"Arize supports drift metrics such as Population Stability Index, KL Divergence, and Wasserstein Distance for measuring distribution drift between the model's production values and a baseline dataset.","
Arize calculates drift metrics such as Population Stability Index, KL Divergence, and Wasserstein Distance. Arize computes drift by measuring distribution changes between the model’s production values and a baseline (reference dataset). Users can configure a baseline to be any time window of a:

1. Pre-production dataset (training, test, validation) or
2. Fixed or moving time period from production (e.g. last 30 days, last 60 days).&#x20;

Baselines are saved in Arize so that users can compare several versions and/or environments against each other across moving or fixed time windows. For more details on baselines, visit here.




Drift monitors measure distribution drift, which is the difference between two statistical distributions.&#x20;

Arize offers various distributional drift metrics to choose from when setting up a monitor. Each metric is tailored to a specific use case; refer to this guide to help choose the appropriate metric for various ML use cases.




Arize supports feature quality metrics including feature drift, data quality (ex: cardinality, percent empty, type mismatch, out of range, etc.) and feature importance metrics. Additionally, users can compute performance metrics for their model filtered by feature/value combinations (slices). &#x20;




Arize supports a comprehensive list of model performance metrics for both numeric and categorical model types. These metrics are available on dashboards as well as monitors.&#x20;

In addition to the out-of-the-gate metrics listed below, Arize also supports model data metrics, custom evaluation metrics, and user defined business impact metrics. Learn more about statistical widgets here and user-defined business impact formulas here.

How do I configure a threshold if my data has seasonality trends?,"If your data has seasonality trends, you can configure a threshold by utilizing the automatic threshold feature provided by Arize. The automatic threshold is generated based on statistical analysis of your data over a period of at least 14 days. This method takes into account the average (mean) and standard deviation of the data points collected each day. By allowing Arize to set the threshold dynamically based on your data, you can adapt to the seasonality trends present in your dataset. Additionally, you can adjust the sensitivity of the auto threshold by modifying the standard deviation number in the 'Monitor Settings' card. This way, you can ensure that the threshold is responsive to the specific patterns and fluctuations in your seasonal data.","
Automatic thresholds set a dynamic threshold value for each data point. Arize generates an auto threshold when there are at least 14 days of production data to determine a trend. You can edit your auto threshold sensitivity by changing the standard deviation number in the 'Monitor Settings' card.&#x20;

Learn more here about how an auto threshold value is calculated.&#x20;

Auto Threshold

Toggle automatic thresholds on or off from the “Edit monitor” configuration.




Autothresholds are calculated based on a statistical analysis of data over 14 days. Each day, a data point is collected, and after 14 days, the average (mean) and standard deviation of these data points are computed. The thresholds is then set by adding or subtracting the standard deviation from the average.




Your baseline can help indicate why your model has drifted. &#x20;

To detect drift over time, set your baseline using **training data** to identify how your model changes between your features, predictions, and actuals. To detect short-term drift, set your baseline using **historical production data** (i.e. 2 weeks).




This section allows to set a specific threshold or allow Arize to automatically adjust the threshold to your data. More details here.

How are clusters in the UMAP calculated? When are the clusters refreshed?,I don't know the exact details of how clusters are calculated in UMAP within the Arize platform or when they are refreshed. It would be best to refer to the specific documentation provided by Arize or reach out to their support team for more detailed information on this topic.,"
1.  **Select your data and Generate UMAP**

    * Select a point on the drift visualization at the top of the page and generate UMAP to visualize the point in time selected

    


2.  **Investigate your worst drifted clusters**

    * Clusters are groups of related points in the point cloud. The closer points or clusters are to each other, the more similar they are. Clusters allow you to easily visualize data that differs from your baseline but also allows you to visualize the global and local structure of your data.

    You can select a specific cluster to further investigate and view the data associated with the cluster
3.  **Investigate the data points that belong in that cluster**&#x20;



    When you select a cluster, Arize surfaces the data associated (shown on the right) and you can further investigate any data point by clicking ""View Details""
4.  **Colorize/Filter your data**&#x20;

    UMAP enables users to identify patterns or the structure in the data to explain where model can be improved by applying colorizations and filters




The UMAP visualization requires each datapoint's prediction ID to be unique. If there are are multiple predictions sent with the same prediction ID, the UMAP visualization cannot fetch all of the columns (features, tags, etc) of that datapoint. Since certain fields of this datapoint cannot be fetched, some color by options will be restricted.&#x20;




Embedding Projectors are a great tool in visualizing and interpreting embeddings. In order to do so, we have to apply an algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings to 2D/3D. UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimensionality reduction technique that belongs to the neighbor graph category. Arize uses it to create a lower dimensional representation (2D or 3D) of your dataset, represented by embedding vectors.&#x20;

Learn more about UMAP in comparison to other neighbor graph algorithms here.&#x20;




After choosing your desired cluster metric (e.g. euclidean distance, accuracy, custom metric, etc.), Arize automatically surfaces the clusters you should focus on for model improvement / troubleshooting so you can quickly find the root cause.&#x20;

Arize automatically surfaces clusters of bad responses to focus on improvement

Baselines are saved in Arize so that users can compare several versions and/or environments against each other across moving or fixed time windows. For more details on baselines, visit here.




Arize can surface outlier/anomalous data through:




Arize drift detection can show the % of values outside of the baseline range. Arize uses the quantiles of the data to calculate the bins of the distribution. If the baseline range has a larger range than the production/serving environment, the user can see the % of volume where the baseline distribution was outside of the production/serving distribution. If the production/serving distribution was outside the range of the baseline distribution, similarly Arize surfaces the % of volume for values outside the baseline range.




Arize calculates the bins within the drift tab using quantiles and fixed bins from the baseline distribution.

The range between two quantile values in the baseline distribution are utilized to calculate a fixed width for binning. That fixed width value will be used to calculate a finite set of bins (currently 8) of a fixed width from the Median value, in both directions (4 in each direction). Lastly, it adds bins to the ""bookends"", one from min value to lowest bin's edge and another from largest bin's edge to maximum value amongst both distributions.

This strategy optimizes for reasonable sized bins by calculating a fixed width based on quantile values.
