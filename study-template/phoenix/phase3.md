Scalability: Ability to handle increasing volumes of lyric policy generation and evaluation data, RAG systems and Agent calls.
- Phoenix is not intended for scale, rather POC / early development cycles. Arize AI AX is built for enterprise scalability (Blog on Arize DB)

Security & Compliance: Assessment of data handling, access control (RBAC), and compliance certifications (e.g., HIPAA, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR).
- Arize AX is built for the complexity and compliance requirements enterprises require. 
 a) RBAC Documentation
 b) trust.arize.com for HIPAA, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR, Pen Tests, etc. 
 c) In addition to RBAC, fine-grained access control is typically required with these deployments

Community & Support: Availability of community support, documentation, and enterprise support options.
- Arize Phoenix has community support only
- With Sharon's effort, you will have access to AI engineers like Jeff Peng or Hakan Tekgul on a weekly basis
 a) These engineers help with best practices, training, onboarding, configuration and other types of support

Deployment Model: Recommendation for open-source self-hosted vs. managed cloud platform, considering data control, maintenance overhead, and compliance needs
- Sharon will be opting for a VPC deployment with separate Development, Test and Production environments in ADPs cloud infrastructure. 

Cost-Benefit Analysis: Detailed financial implications and ROI.
 - This is a particularly deep topic. Arize AI has ~130 engineers building AX, building this in-house will require a unique skill set of infrastructure, front-end engineering, database and AI expertise.
  a) Most teams do not have the resources or bandwidth to build an AI engineering platform from scratch unless it has Facebook level resources
  b) For example, Uber leverages Arize, which typically builds all technology in-house. It is a complicated effort which encouraged them to see outside support
  c) Even if using Phoenix as a baseline, the services and infrastructure that would have to be built around it for production use cases would take many engineers across many disciplines (ranging from infra, database, front-end etc.)
  d) With Sharon's team's resources they are still opting to buy over build. It might be useful to discuss with her how she is thinking about it.
