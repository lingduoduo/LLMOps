Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, fueling a wide range of Lyric applications from Global Search to ADP Assist. However, ensuring the reliability, transparency, and trustworthiness of LLM-based systems remains a critical challenge. Implementing a robust LLM evaluation framework is essential to address these challenges, showing how tracing and evaluation tools can support transparency, reliability, and continuous improvement in our applications. 

Evaluation frameworks for LLM observability and tracing have rapidly evolved to meet the growing demand for transparency, reliability, and performance monitoring in generative AI systems. Tools like Arize Phoenix and Langfuse provide comprehensive observability, supporting both LLM and traditional ML workflows, with features such as token-level analysis, deep tracing, and prompt management. Confident AI / DeepEval focuses on test-based evaluation, enabling CI/CD-style checks to ensure model quality and consistency. Platforms like LangSmith and Traceloop offer tight integration with popular frameworks and structured logging for robust debugging. Lightweight tools such as PromptLayer and Helicone specialize in OpenAI-specific logging, cost tracking, and prompt analytics. This project represents the first phase of our evaluation initiative, with the primary goal of researching and comparing Langfuse (Github 13.9k star), Arize Phoenix (Github star), and Confident AI / DeepEval (Github 9.3k), focusing on core capabilities including tracing, prompt and dataset management, custom metrics, and human annotation workflows.

This project marks the first phase of our evaluation initiative, aimed at comparing three leading LLM observability frameworks‚ÄîLangfuse (13.9k GitHub stars), Arize Phoenix (GitHub stars not listed), and Confident AI / DeepEval (9.3k GitHub stars)‚Äîacross four core capabilities: tracing, prompt and dataset management, custom metrics, and human-annotation workflows.

Feature	Confident AI: Rationale & Source
‚úÖ LLM & non-LLM calls	Confident AI‚Äôs SaaS platform (not just DeepEval OSS) supports end-to-end ‚Äúinference pipelines‚Äù tracing. They explicitly state you can monitor LLM calls with inputs/outputs and attach metadata. However, non-LLM spans (e.g., DB queries, vectorstore retrievals) are not first-class citizens yet ‚Äî unlike Arize and Langfuse.
‚úÖ Multi-turn context	They describe ‚Äúsession-level‚Äù monitoring to track context over a conversation.
‚úÖ Metadata / span details	Supported through custom attributes on traces.
‚úÖ Cost & latency tracking	Their dashboards show latency, throughput, and API costs.
‚úÖ SDK integrations	Python SDK is officially supported. Confident AI also offers DeepEval.ts, which supports tracing in JS/Typescript in the form of wrapper functions to easily capture traces in JS/TS-native applications. 

https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs/llm-tracing/integrations/typescript#code--video-demo
üö´ Multimodal	No mention of image/audio tracing in Confident AI docs as of today.

Pros
LLM Call Tracing: Confident AI‚Äôs SaaS platform supports end-to-end tracing of LLM inference pipelines. It captures inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each LLM call.

Multi-turn Context Support: The platform offers session-level monitoring, enabling developers to trace conversations across multiple turns‚Äîuseful for chat-based applications.

Confident AI Tracing:
 
Running an LLM application in ADP environment and tracing it to the dashboard is feasible. DeepEval.ts is potentially useful if we want to trace our Typescript services.  


Evaluation
Phoenix integrates both automated and manual evaluation workflows. It supports built-in and custom metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, semantic similarity) as well as human-in-the-loop review. The framework links evaluation results directly to experiments and traces, helping users systematically assess model improvements and understand performance dynamics.
Here are the main ways you can use Evaluation in Phoenix:
Automatic/Programmatic Evaluation
‚Ä¢	Use built-in or custom Evaluator classes to assess your outputs programmatically.
‚Ä¢	Evaluation can be called as part of your code when testing a prompt, RAG chain, or agent.
‚Ä¢	You write rules/metrics (e.g., accuracy, toxicity, hallucination etc.), and run these automatically over batches of inputs/outputs.
‚Ä¢	Useful for rapid, repeatable evaluation without human effort (like daily test runs).
Human (Manual) Evaluation
‚Ä¢	Phoenix supports adding Human feedback by letting you create evaluation tasks for annotators.
‚Ä¢	Human evaluators can score outputs (e.g., on correctness, helpfulness, etc.) and this can be visualized alongside metric-based scores.
‚Ä¢	Some use a UI, others upload CSVs with human ratings.
Multi-metric and Holistic Evaluation
‚Ä¢	You can combine multiple evaluators (automated and human) in one run.
‚Ä¢	Score the model on quality, factuality, toxicity, instructional following, etc., all at once.
‚Ä¢	Analyze tradeoffs across metrics directly in the dashboard.
Continuous or Regression Evaluation
‚Ä¢	Automate evaluation on every new code/model release to monitor performance changes.
‚Ä¢	Run evaluations as part of CI/CD for quality gates.
Visual and Interactive Evaluation
‚Ä¢	Use the Phoenix dashboard to explore evaluation results, filter problems, analyze failure cases, and compare models side-by-side.
‚Ä¢	See distributions, top errors, and drill down to actual input/output pairs.
Custom/Advanced Evaluation
‚Ä¢	Write your own scoring/evaluation functions using LLMs, rubric grading, regex, or more complex pipelines.
‚Ä¢	Evaluate not just final answers, but intermediate steps (in agents or chains) using custom hooks.
Strengths
1.	Continuous Monitoring: Can be hooked into automated tests/CI for ongoing regression detection.
2.	Facilitates Error Analysis: Makes it fast to spot edge cases and systematically improve your app‚Äôs weak spots.
3.	Integrated Dashboard: Unified place to compare, analyze, and drill down into evaluation results visually.
4.	Multi-metric Reporting: Evaluate on many axes (accuracy, relevance, harmlessness, etc.) simultaneously.
5.	Flexible & Rich Evaluations: Supports both automated metrics and human-in-the-loop feedback; extensible to custom use-cases.
6.	Plug-and-Play: Works with LLMs, chains, agents, and integrates well with many existing workflows.
Weaknesses
1.	Data and Scaling: Large batch evaluations (especially with human or LLM-in-the-loop metrics) can be costly and slow, particularly with big datasets.
2.	Limited Out-of-the-Box Metrics: Some evaluation needs (domain-specific, specialized behaviors) require custom implementation.


Pros
Model-Based Evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge): Langfuse supports automated evaluations using large language models to assess output quality‚Äîscoring factors such as accuracy, hallucination, and toxicity without human input.

Custom Scoring Workflows: You can define and ingest your own evaluation metrics via Langfuse‚Äôs SDK or API. This includes logic for structured format checks, domain-specific scoring, or external evaluation pipeline integration.

Subjective Metric Support: Flexible metric definition allows you to evaluate subjective aspects (e.g., lyrical creativity or tone), tailoring evaluations to your specific application needs.

Human Annotation Integration: Manual annotations can be added directly through the Langfuse UI, enabling team-based review processes. These annotations help benchmark automated evaluations and validate models.

User Feedback Capture: Langfuse enables both explicit (e.g., thumbs up/down, 5-star ratings) and implicit (e.g., engagement time, click-throughs, acceptance/rejection) feedback to be tied to traces, providing a rich layer for behavioral evaluation.

Development and Production Coverage: Evaluations can be run on both curated datasets during development and live application traces in production, enabling iterative, real-world performance tracking.

Multimodal Readiness: Langfuse can incorporate non-text data into evaluations, which is useful for applications like lyric generation that may involve audio, metadata, or visuals.

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons
LLM-as-a-Judge Requires Tuning: Automatic scoring by LLMs can be subjective or inconsistent unless carefully prompt-engineered and validated against human benchmarks.

Annotation Workflow Can Be Manual: While Langfuse supports manual annotations, scaling this process across large datasets still requires time and team effort.

Evaluation Requires Setup: Custom evaluations, while powerful, require engineering effort to define metrics, structure feedback ingestion, and build evaluation pipelines.

No Built-in Dataset Curation Tools: Langfuse assumes you bring your own datasets for evaluation‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt provide tools for dataset creation, labeling, or version control out of the box.

Pros
Rich Set of Prebuilt Evaluation Metrics: Confident AI provides a wide variety of ready-to-use metrics out of the box‚Äîcovering summarization, hallucination, bias, toxicity, coherence, RAG performance, agentic tasks, and conversational quality. These are well-documented and can be executed using any LLM, traditional NLP methods, or statistical models.

Flexible Evaluation Modes: Supports both end-to-end evaluation (e.g., final outputs) and component-level evaluation (e.g., intermediate steps like tool usage or context relevance), making it useful for complex pipelines like RAG or agent frameworks.

LLM-as-a-Judge Support: Enables model-based scoring with predefined rubrics, allowing LLMs to assess outputs automatically with minimal setup.

Custom Metric Support: Users can define their own prompt-based or Python-based evaluation logic, which integrates smoothly with the DeepEval ecosystem.

Web-Based Human Annotation Tool: Confident AI SaaS includes a user-friendly web interface to collect human ratings and compare them with model-generated scores.

Supports Batch and Real-Time Evaluation: Works well in both development (offline/batch mode) and production (live monitoring), helping teams close the loop on quality feedback.

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons
SaaS Dependency for Full Functionality: Many advanced features (like annotation tools and dashboards) are only available through the hosted Confident AI SaaS platform, which may not be suitable for teams requiring self-hosting.

No Multimodal Evaluation Support: Current documentation makes no mention of support for image, video, or audio evaluation‚Äîlimiting use in non-text-heavy applications.

Potential Access Restrictions: In some enterprise settings (e.g., ADP), access to Confident AI SaaS documentation or services may be blocked, limiting usability.

Complexity for Lightweight Use Cases: While powerful, the breadth of options and configurations may be more than needed for simple LLM applications, where a few prompt-based checks might suffice.



















Arize Phoenix & Langfuse:
Both are designed for ML observability and LLMops. Both already trace arbitrary spans, multimodal (to some extent), with mature OpenTelemetry-inspired designs. That‚Äôs why they score slightly better on non-LLM calls & multimodal today.
Confident AI Tracing:
 
Running an LLM application in ADP environment and tracing it to the dashboard is feasible. DeepEval.ts is potentially useful if we want to trace our Typescript services.  

Langfuse is a great choice for most production use cases, particularly when comprehensive tracing, prompt management, deep evaluation capabilities, and robust usage monitoring are critical. Its ability to provide detailed insights into both LLM and non-LLM activities, along with support for asynchronous logging and various framework integrations, makes it ideal for complex applications requiring thorough observability. How Langfuse provides detailed tracing and quality monitoring through developer-friendly APIs. While it supports multi-step workflows effectively, it lacks support for the OpenTelemetry protocol and can be difficult to customize for non-standard use cases.

Arize Phoenix is a strong option if your company already uses Arize AI‚Äôs enterprise platform and is focused on the experimental and development stages of LLM applications. It offers tools for evaluation and troubleshooting . However, its lack of prompt management and comprehensive LLM usage monitoring features may limit its effectiveness in production environments, making it less suitable for teams requiring these capabilities. Where Phoenix fits into the process by combining experimentation and debugging capabilities with evaluation pipelines. Its strength lies in development-focused observability, but it has limitations in handling real-time tracing once systems are in production.

Langfuse has a polished UI and solid community momentum, but imposes friction around hosting and feature access. Arize Phoenix offers a more open, developer-friendly experience‚Äîespecially for those who want a single-container solution with built-in instrumentation and evaluation tools.




By leveraging Langfuse, we aim to demonstrate how it can effectively support the evaluation and improvement of lyric applications.
Langfuse supports two deployment models to fit different operational needs:
-	Langfuse Cloud, a fully managed service for ease of use and scalability
-	a Self-Hosted option for teams needing greater control over data, security, and infrastructure. 
For this proof-of-concept evaluation, we are using the self-hosted deployment to test and validate features in an environment that mirrors our production requirements.

Confident AI is the SasS platform for DeepEval, the most widely adopted open-source framework to evaluate LLM applications. If we were to opt for purchasing the SasS version, the platform almost provides all functional requirements except for multimodal capabilities. The other option is to leverage the DeepEval library only, which provides the customized evaluation for LLM applications offline with curated datasets but other functionalities (tracing, prompt management, dataset management, UI dashboard/reporting) do not exist. It is not self-hostable. Another reality as of today is that we have access to Confident AI documentation is automatically deniied by ADP.

With Arize Phoenix, getting started is relatively straightforward because you can run it locally and start iterating quickly during the development and experiment phases. However, once you‚Äôre ready for production ‚Äî or if you want to collaborate with your teammates ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to deploy Phoenix. In addition to a managed hosted version of Phoenix, there are self-hosted options. The Phoenix app can be run in various environments such as Colab and SageMaker notebooks, as well as be served via the terminal or a docker container.



Core Features
Langfuse Dashboard
The Langfuse dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all critical metrics for monitoring LLM applications. It includes detailed insights such as overall volume usage by model or token type, cost breakdowns by user, latency distributions, and quality metrics. Tracing is at the core of the platform, enabling teams to deeply understand and optimize their LLM workflows.
Tracing
Langfuse‚Äôs tracing feature captures all interactions within your LLM application, offering end-to-end visibility. For example, in a typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application, traces reveal the complete interaction flow‚Äîfrom which documents were retrieved from the corpus and how the embedding workflow operated, to the final context that shaped the response. This level of detail helps teams analyze and debug generation quality, optimize prompts, and understand cost and latency drivers. Log traces deliver the lowest level of transparency, empowering developers to identify performance bottlenecks and cost hotspots with precision.
Prompts
In simple terms, Langfuse‚Äôs prompt management acts as a Prompt Content Management System, making it easy to version, edit, and deploy prompts to production while enabling instant rollbacks when needed. This ensures that everyone on the team can contribute to prompt development and see exactly which prompts are in use without touching the codebase.

Prompts in Langfuse are tightly integrated with tracing, so you can link any specific trace, good or bad, back to the exact prompt that produced it. This connection allows for meaningful root cause analysis and continuous improvement. Langfuse‚Äôs prompt management features support version control and deployment, collaborative editing, and testing of prompts and models, streamlining the workflow for prompt engineering teams.
Evals
Evaluation in Langfuse is essential for truly understanding how your LLM-powered application performs in practice. The Langfuse interface makes it easy to apply different evaluation methods to production applications, capturing user feedback and comments directly through the SDKs. You can configure Langfuse to automatically run evaluators, such as element-based checks or LLM-judge evaluations, on all newly created traces. These evaluators can analyze the entire trace, including inputs and outputs, or focus on specific sections of the interaction.

This flexible evaluation approach allows you to measure output quality, monitor production health, and test changes safely in development, ensuring continuous improvement and reliability in your LLM workflows.
Datasets and Experiments
Put simply, datasets in Langfuse are collections of example inputs and expected outputs that can be used during development to test and evaluate your LLM applications. Langfuse‚Äôs datasets and experiments functionality helps you systematically compare different prompt versions, so you can make informed decisions about which ones to promote to production.

This capability is especially valuable for teams that want to rapidly iterate on new ideas each week, whether it‚Äôs refining prompts, testing a new model checkpoint, exploring a different agent strategy, trying an updated retrieval method, or adjusting configurations. Experimentation in Langfuse makes it easy to validate these changes in a controlled way before deploying them to production, supporting a culture of continuous improvement and safe innovation.
Playground
The Langfuse playground provides an interactive environment for testing and iterating on your prompts directly within the platform. You can start from scratch to design new prompts or quickly jump in to refine existing ones. This streamlined workflow makes it easy to experiment, validate changes, and fine-tune prompts before deploying them to production, ensuring higher quality and consistency in your LLM applications.
Evaluation Platform Setup
To enable effective evaluation of our LLM-powered applications, we will prepare and organize relevant data sources to serve as test and evaluation sets within the platform.
Data Sources
The curated datasets will be used to configure evaluations, run experiments, and analyze LLM performance across key workflows, supporting continuous improvement of our application.
‚Ä¢	Action and Smart Action Data: Includes logs and structured records of user actions and smart actions taken in the application. This data helps evaluate how well the LLM understands context and suggests appropriate actions.

‚Ä¢	Question and Answer Data: Consists of question-answer pairs, representing realistic user queries and expected responses. This data is crucial for testing prompt quality, model accuracy, and consistency in generating relevant, high-quality answers.
Evaluating LLM Application Components
To ensure high-quality performance and reliability, our evaluation framework will include targeted functions for assessing the following critical components of the LLM application. This notebook outlines the overall evaluation workflow along with recommended configurations for processing typical user queries.

Evaluate the quality and relevance of generated embeddings using models like Titan V2 - 1024 or OpenAI‚Äôs embedding offerings. Assess semantic similarity to ground truth examples and effectiveness in retrieval tasks through metrics such as cosine similarity, retrieval precision, and qualitative analyses of the embedding space.
Intent Classification (Redis VL, OpenSearch c7g.large, etc.)
Measure the accuracy and consistency of intent recognition to ensure the model correctly identifies user intents. Evaluation methods will include comparison against labeled intent data, confusion matrix analysis, and calculation of precision, recall, and F1 scores to quantify classification performance.
Hybrid Search (Redis VL, OpenSearch c7g.large, etc.)
Assess the effectiveness of combining semantic and keyword-based search strategies using systems like Redis Vector Layer or OpenSearch (e.g., c7g.large instances). Focus will be on relevance ranking quality, retrieval coverage, and user-centric metrics such as top-k accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).
Reranker (Cohere, Nova Lite, etc.)
Evaluate reranking models and strategies‚Äîsuch as Coherent or Nova Lite‚Äîthat reorder initial retrieval results for greater relevance. Metrics will include ranking accuracy, NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain), and qualitative analyses comparing improvements over baseline rankings.
Parameter Extraction (LangChain Tool Calling, Nova Pro, etc.)
Assess the model‚Äôs ability to accurately extract structured parameters or entities from user input using tools like LangChain‚Äôs Tool Calling or Nova Pro. Evaluation will focus on precision and recall of extracted parameters, along with consistency and robustness across diverse input types and edge cases.
