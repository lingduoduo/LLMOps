Objectives

This project will deliver a proof-of-concept implementation using Langfuse to evaluate lyric generation outputs, demonstrating tracing, prompt management, and dataset management in practice. It will also produce a comparative analysis document that summarizes Langfuse’s suitability relative to other tools (such as Arize Phoenix and Confident AI/DeepEval), with particular attention to support for custom metrics, human annotation workflows and results. Key focus areas include tracing and observability of LLM outputs, evaluation methods (including pre-built options, custom metrics, LLM-as-a-judge, and human-in-the-loop workflows), and robust prompt and dataset management capabilities.

Outcomes

By leveraging Langfuse, we aim to demonstrate how it can effectively support the evaluation and improvement of lyric generation applications. Langfuse enables full context capture by tracking complete execution flows, including API calls, prompts, parallelism, and more. It offers cost monitoring to track model usage and spending across the application. Quality insights are generated through user feedback collection and identification of low-quality outputs. Additionally, Langfuse facilitates high-quality dataset creation for fine-tuning and testing while supporting robust root cause analysis to quickly identify and debug issues in complex LLM workflows.

Langfuse supports two deployment models to fit different operational needs: Langfuse Cloud, a fully managed service for ease of use and scalability, and a Self-Hosted option (detailed in their Self-Hosting Guide) for teams needing greater control over data, security, and infrastructure. For this proof-of-concept evaluation, we are using the self-hosted deployment to test and validate features in an environment that mirrors our production requirements.

Core Features

Langfuse Dashboard
 The Langfuse dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all critical metrics for monitoring LLM applications. It includes detailed insights such as overall volume usage by model or token type, cost breakdowns by user, latency distributions, and quality metrics. Tracing is at the core of the platform, enabling teams to deeply understand and optimize their LLM workflows.

Tracing
 Langfuse’s tracing feature captures all interactions within your LLM application, offering end-to-end visibility. For example, in a typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application, traces reveal the complete interaction flow—from which documents were retrieved from the corpus and how the embedding workflow operated, to the final context that shaped the response. This level of detail helps teams analyze and debug generation quality, optimize prompts, and understand cost and latency drivers. Log traces deliver the lowest level of transparency, empowering developers to identify performance bottlenecks and cost hotspots with precision.

Prompts
 In simple terms, Langfuse’s prompt management acts as a Prompt Content Management System, making it easy to version, edit, and deploy prompts to production while enabling instant rollbacks when needed. This ensures that everyone on the team can contribute to prompt development and see exactly which prompts are in use—without touching the codebase.

Prompts in Langfuse are tightly integrated with tracing, so you can link any specific trace—good or bad—back to the exact prompt that produced it. This connection allows for meaningful root cause analysis and continuous improvement. Langfuse’s prompt management features support version control and deployment, collaborative editing, and testing of prompts and models, streamlining the workflow for prompt engineering teams.

Evals
 Evaluation in Langfuse is essential for truly understanding how your LLM-powered application performs in practice. The Langfuse interface makes it easy to apply different evaluation methods to production applications, capturing user feedback and comments directly through the SDKs. You can configure Langfuse to automatically run evaluators—such as element-based checks or LLM-judge evaluations—on all newly created traces. These evaluators can analyze the entire trace, including inputs and outputs, or focus on specific sections of the interaction.

This flexible evaluation approach allows you to measure output quality, monitor production health, and test changes safely in development, ensuring continuous improvement and reliability in your LLM workflows.

Datasets and Experiments
 Put simply, datasets in Langfuse are collections of example inputs and expected outputs that can be used during development to test and evaluate your LLM applications. Langfuse’s datasets and experiments functionality helps you systematically compare different prompt versions, so you can make informed decisions about which ones to promote to production.

This capability is especially valuable for teams that want to rapidly iterate on new ideas each week—whether it’s refining prompts, testing a new model checkpoint, exploring a different agent strategy, trying an updated retrieval method, or adjusting configurations. Experimentation in Langfuse makes it easy to validate these changes in a controlled way before deploying them to production, supporting a culture of continuous improvement and safe innovation.

Playground
 The Langfuse playground provides an interactive environment for testing and iterating on your prompts directly within the platform. You can start from scratch to design new prompts or quickly jump in to refine existing ones. This streamlined workflow makes it easy to experiment, validate changes, and fine-tune prompts before deploying them to production, ensuring higher quality and consistency in your LLM applications.

Evaluation Platform Setup

*Data Preparation:
 To enable effective evaluation of our LLM-powered applications, we will prepare and organize relevant data sources to serve as test and evaluation sets within the platform.

Data Sources:

- Action and Smart Action Data: Includes logs and structured records of user actions and smart actions taken in the application. This data helps evaluate how well the LLM understands context and suggests appropriate actions.
- Question and Answer Data: Consists of question-answer pairs, representing realistic user queries and expected responses. This data is crucial for testing prompt quality, model accuracy, and consistency in generating relevant, high-quality answers.

These curated datasets will be used to configure evaluations, run experiments, and analyze LLM performance across key workflows, supporting continuous improvement of our application.

Evaluating LLM Application Components

To ensure high-quality performance and reliability, our evaluation framework will include targeted functions for assessing the following critical components of the LLM application. This notebook outlines the overall evaluation workflow along with recommended configurations for processing typical user queries.

- Embedding Model (OpenAI Embedding, Titan V2 - 1024, etc.): Evaluate the quality and relevance of generated embeddings using models like Titan V2 - 1024 or OpenAI’s embedding offerings. Assess semantic similarity to ground truth examples and effectiveness in retrieval tasks through metrics such as cosine similarity, retrieval precision, and qualitative analyses of the embedding space.
- Intent Classification: Measure the accuracy and consistency of intent recognition to ensure the model correctly identifies user goals. Evaluation methods will include comparison against labeled intent data, confusion matrix analysis, and calculation of precision, recall, and F1 scores to quantify classification performance.
- Hybrid Search (Redis VL, OpenSearch c7g.large, etc.): Assess the effectiveness of combining semantic and keyword-based search strategies using systems like Redis Vector Layer or OpenSearch (e.g., c7g.large instances). Focus will be on relevance ranking quality, retrieval coverage, and user-centric metrics such as top-k accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).
- Reranker (Coherent, Nova Lite, etc.): Evaluate reranking models and strategies—such as Coherent or Nova Lite—that reorder initial retrieval results for greater relevance. Metrics will include ranking accuracy, NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain), and qualitative analyses comparing improvements over baseline rankings.
- Parameter Extraction (LangChain Tool Calling, Nova Pro, etc.): Assess the model’s ability to accurately extract structured parameters or entities from user input using tools like LangChain’s Tool Calling or Nova Pro. Evaluation will focus on precision and recall of extracted parameters, along with consistency and robustness across diverse input types and edge cases.

These targeted evaluation functions, combined with the recommended configurations, will provide comprehensive insights into the performance of each component, supporting continuous improvement and the development of robust, production-ready LLM workflows.
