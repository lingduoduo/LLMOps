Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, fueling a wide range of Lyric applications from Global Search to ADP Assist. However, ensuring the reliability, transparency, and trustworthiness of LLM-based systems remains a critical challenge. Implementing a robust LLM evaluation framework is essential to address these challenges, showing how tracing and evaluation tools can support transparency, reliability, and continuous improvement in our applications. 

Evaluation frameworks for LLM observability and tracing have rapidly evolved to meet the growing demand for transparency, reliability, and performance monitoring in generative AI systems. Tools like Arize Phoenix and Langfuse provide comprehensive observability, supporting both LLM and traditional ML workflows, with features such as token-level analysis, deep tracing, and prompt management. Confident AI / DeepEval focuses on test-based evaluation, enabling CI/CD-style checks to ensure model quality and consistency. Platforms like LangSmith and Traceloop offer tight integration with popular frameworks and structured logging for robust debugging. Lightweight tools such as PromptLayer and Helicone specialize in OpenAI-specific logging, cost tracking, and prompt analytics. This project represents the first phase of our evaluation initiative, with the primary goal of researching and comparing Langfuse, Arize Phoenix, and Confident AI / DeepEval, focusing on core capabilities including tracing, prompt and dataset management, custom metrics, and human annotation workflows.





By leveraging Langfuse, we aim to demonstrate how it can effectively support the evaluation and improvement of lyric applications.
 
Langfuse supports two deployment models to fit different operational needs:
-	Langfuse Cloud, a fully managed service for ease of use and scalability
-	a Self-Hosted option for teams needing greater control over data, security, and infrastructure. 
For this proof-of-concept evaluation, we are using the self-hosted deployment to test and validate features in an environment that mirrors our production requirements.
Core Features
Langfuse Dashboard
The Langfuse dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all critical metrics for monitoring LLM applications. It includes detailed insights such as overall volume usage by model or token type, cost breakdowns by user, latency distributions, and quality metrics. Tracing is at the core of the platform, enabling teams to deeply understand and optimize their LLM workflows.
Tracing
Langfuse’s tracing feature captures all interactions within your LLM application, offering end-to-end visibility. For example, in a typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application, traces reveal the complete interaction flow—from which documents were retrieved from the corpus and how the embedding workflow operated, to the final context that shaped the response. This level of detail helps teams analyze and debug generation quality, optimize prompts, and understand cost and latency drivers. Log traces deliver the lowest level of transparency, empowering developers to identify performance bottlenecks and cost hotspots with precision.
Prompts
In simple terms, Langfuse’s prompt management acts as a Prompt Content Management System, making it easy to version, edit, and deploy prompts to production while enabling instant rollbacks when needed. This ensures that everyone on the team can contribute to prompt development and see exactly which prompts are in use without touching the codebase.

Prompts in Langfuse are tightly integrated with tracing, so you can link any specific trace, good or bad, back to the exact prompt that produced it. This connection allows for meaningful root cause analysis and continuous improvement. Langfuse’s prompt management features support version control and deployment, collaborative editing, and testing of prompts and models, streamlining the workflow for prompt engineering teams.
Evals
Evaluation in Langfuse is essential for truly understanding how your LLM-powered application performs in practice. The Langfuse interface makes it easy to apply different evaluation methods to production applications, capturing user feedback and comments directly through the SDKs. You can configure Langfuse to automatically run evaluators, such as element-based checks or LLM-judge evaluations, on all newly created traces. These evaluators can analyze the entire trace, including inputs and outputs, or focus on specific sections of the interaction.

This flexible evaluation approach allows you to measure output quality, monitor production health, and test changes safely in development, ensuring continuous improvement and reliability in your LLM workflows.
Datasets and Experiments
Put simply, datasets in Langfuse are collections of example inputs and expected outputs that can be used during development to test and evaluate your LLM applications. Langfuse’s datasets and experiments functionality helps you systematically compare different prompt versions, so you can make informed decisions about which ones to promote to production.

This capability is especially valuable for teams that want to rapidly iterate on new ideas each week, whether it’s refining prompts, testing a new model checkpoint, exploring a different agent strategy, trying an updated retrieval method, or adjusting configurations. Experimentation in Langfuse makes it easy to validate these changes in a controlled way before deploying them to production, supporting a culture of continuous improvement and safe innovation.
Playground
The Langfuse playground provides an interactive environment for testing and iterating on your prompts directly within the platform. You can start from scratch to design new prompts or quickly jump in to refine existing ones. This streamlined workflow makes it easy to experiment, validate changes, and fine-tune prompts before deploying them to production, ensuring higher quality and consistency in your LLM applications.
Evaluation Platform Setup
To enable effective evaluation of our LLM-powered applications, we will prepare and organize relevant data sources to serve as test and evaluation sets within the platform.
Data Sources
The curated datasets will be used to configure evaluations, run experiments, and analyze LLM performance across key workflows, supporting continuous improvement of our application.
•	Action and Smart Action Data: Includes logs and structured records of user actions and smart actions taken in the application. This data helps evaluate how well the LLM understands context and suggests appropriate actions.

•	Question and Answer Data: Consists of question-answer pairs, representing realistic user queries and expected responses. This data is crucial for testing prompt quality, model accuracy, and consistency in generating relevant, high-quality answers.
Evaluating LLM Application Components
To ensure high-quality performance and reliability, our evaluation framework will include targeted functions for assessing the following critical components of the LLM application. This notebook outlines the overall evaluation workflow along with recommended configurations for processing typical user queries.
Embedding Model (OpenAI Embedding, Titan V2 - 1024, etc.)
Evaluate the quality and relevance of generated embeddings using models like Titan V2 - 1024 or OpenAI’s embedding offerings. Assess semantic similarity to ground truth examples and effectiveness in retrieval tasks through metrics such as cosine similarity, retrieval precision, and qualitative analyses of the embedding space.
Intent Classification (Redis VL, OpenSearch c7g.large, etc.)
Measure the accuracy and consistency of intent recognition to ensure the model correctly identifies user intents. Evaluation methods will include comparison against labeled intent data, confusion matrix analysis, and calculation of precision, recall, and F1 scores to quantify classification performance.
Hybrid Search (Redis VL, OpenSearch c7g.large, etc.)
Assess the effectiveness of combining semantic and keyword-based search strategies using systems like Redis Vector Layer or OpenSearch (e.g., c7g.large instances). Focus will be on relevance ranking quality, retrieval coverage, and user-centric metrics such as top-k accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).
Reranker (Cohere, Nova Lite, etc.)
Evaluate reranking models and strategies—such as Coherent or Nova Lite—that reorder initial retrieval results for greater relevance. Metrics will include ranking accuracy, NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain), and qualitative analyses comparing improvements over baseline rankings.
Parameter Extraction (LangChain Tool Calling, Nova Pro, etc.)
Assess the model’s ability to accurately extract structured parameters or entities from user input using tools like LangChain’s Tool Calling or Nova Pro. Evaluation will focus on precision and recall of extracted parameters, along with consistency and robustness across diverse input types and edge cases.
